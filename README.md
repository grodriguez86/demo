# The solution
Spring boot REST API to solve backend challenge. I have used an in-memory database, the H2 database. Application class is DemoApplication.java. 
Added JUnit tests in DemoApplicationTests.java for:

* Simple reservation creation and retrieval.
* Multiple thread reservation creation.
* Checking for availability maximun.
